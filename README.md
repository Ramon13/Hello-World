# hello-world
Hi, everywone.

My name is Ramon and i am a self-taught computer science student living in Brazil. I love solve algorithm problems, like the rakerhank, cs50 and uri-online-judge problems. So far i have been studying java and c languages, most specifficaly, web based systems whith servlets and deepening some concepts about data structures, algorithms, regex, linux OS and so on. Im studying following the OSSU (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and developer-roadmap backend (https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) guides. :-)
